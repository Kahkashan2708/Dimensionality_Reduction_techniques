#  Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality Reduction is a crucial concept in Machine Learning and Data Science that helps simplify complex high-dimensional datasets while preserving their meaningful structure and relationships. This repository provides implementations and explanations of popular dimensionality reduction techniques including **PCA, LDA, SVD, Isomap, t-SNE, and UMAP**.

## What is Dimensionality Reduction?

In real-world datasets, we often deal with hundreds or thousands of features. High-dimensional data:
- Increases computational cost
- Leads to **overfitting** (curse of dimensionality)
- Makes **visualization** difficult

Dimensionality Reduction transforms data from a high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional one, keeping only the most **important information**.

---

## Objectives
- Reduce noise and redundancy  
- Improve model performance  
- Simplify visualization of high-dimensional data  
- Speed up computations

## Types of Dimensionality Reduction

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Feature Selection** | Selecting a subset of relevant features without transforming them | Forward Selection, Lasso, Tree-based selection |
| **Feature Extraction** | Creating new transformed features from existing ones | PCA, LDA, SVD, Isomap, t-SNE, UMAP |

This repository focuses on **Feature Extraction** techniques.

## Techniques Covered

### 1️⃣ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
**Type:** Linear  
**Concept:**  
PCA projects data onto directions (principal components) that maximize variance.  
It is widely used for **data compression** and **visualization**.

**Advantages:**
- Simple and efficient
- Reduces correlation among features
- Retains maximum variance

**Disadvantages:**
- Assumes linearity
- Sensitive to scaling

---

### 2️⃣ Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
**Type:** Supervised Linear  
**Concept:**  
Unlike PCA, LDA uses class labels and tries to **maximize class separability**.  
It finds axes that best distinguish between multiple classes.

**Advantages:**
- Improves classification accuracy  
- Works well for labeled data  

**Disadvantages:**
- Assumes normal distribution and equal covariance
- Not ideal for non-linear separations

---

### 3️⃣ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
**Type:** Linear Algebra Technique  
**Concept:**  
SVD decomposes a matrix into three parts:  
\( A = U \Sigma V^T \)  
It helps in noise reduction, latent semantic analysis, and feature extraction.

**Advantages:**
- Strong mathematical foundation  
- Useful in text and image data  

**Disadvantages:**
- Computationally expensive for large matrices  

---

### 4️⃣ Isomap
**Type:** Non-Linear (Manifold Learning)  
**Concept:**  
Isomap preserves **geodesic distances** between all data points on a manifold.  
It combines **K-Nearest Neighbors** and **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**.

**Advantages:**
- Captures non-linear structure
- Good for manifold-shaped data  

**Disadvantages:**
- Sensitive to neighborhood size (k)
- Struggles with noise or disconnected manifolds  

---

### 5️⃣ t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
**Type:** Non-Linear  
**Concept:**  
t-SNE models pairwise similarities between points using probability distributions and minimizes divergence between high and low-dimensional representations.

**Advantages:**
- Excellent for visualizing clusters (2D/3D)
- Preserves local structure  

**Disadvantages:**
- Computationally heavy
- Not ideal for very large datasets  

---

### 6️⃣ UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
**Type:** Non-Linear  
**Concept:**  
UMAP is a faster alternative to t-SNE that preserves both local and global structures using topology and manifold theory.

**Advantages:**
- Much faster than t-SNE  
- Preserves both local and global relationships  
- Scales to large datasets  

**Disadvantages:**
- Has several hyperparameters to tune
